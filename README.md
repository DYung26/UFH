## Story and Technical Details

**Inspiration**: The idea for UFH stemmed from the need for a single platform to manage both fiat and cryptocurrency accounts efficiently. As someone passionate about personal finance and technology, I saw an opportunity to streamline financial management into one accessible tool.

**Technical Challenges**: One of the major challenges was integrating with various financial institutions' APIs, which required handling authentication and different data formats. I tackled this by starting with a limited set of integrations and focusing on building a solid MVP. 

**Future Directions**: UFH has the potential to expand with more financial institutions and explore blockchain technology for enhanced security and transparency. Open-source contributions are encouraged to grow the platform and incorporate more features over time.

**Personal Growth**: This project was an excellent opportunity for me to learn and implement new technologies, including TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS for the frontend, and deepen my understanding of Python and PostgreSQL for the console application. I also discovered my preference for TypeScript and enhanced my skills in Python and database management.
